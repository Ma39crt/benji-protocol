COM5413 — The Benji Protocol
Task 4: The Web Enumerator
File:   web_enum.py
================================================================================

MISSION BRIEF
-------------
The web layer talks too much. Server versions buried in HTTP headers. Developer
notes left in HTML comments. Sensitive paths left exposed because nobody
thought to check. Benji listens. A well-configured web server tells you almost
nothing; most servers are not well-configured.

Your job is to build an HTTP reconnaissance tool that extracts intelligence
from HTTP response headers and HTML source. This is passive reconnaissance —
you are reading what the server is already broadcasting, not probing for
weaknesses directly.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT MUST DO
-------------------------
1. Accept a target URL as a command-line argument.
2. Send an HTTP GET request and analyse the response headers for:
   - Server (e.g., Apache/2.2.8)
   - X-Powered-By (e.g., PHP/5.2.4)
   - Any other headers that reveal technology or version information.
3. Parse the HTML response using BeautifulSoup to extract:
   - All HTML comments (<!-- --> blocks) — flags are often hidden here.
4. Check for the existence of sensitive paths:
   - /robots.txt
   - /admin
   - /phpmyadmin
   - /login
   - /.git
   (Report found/not found for each — do not enumerate further.)
5. Output a structured summary (JSON or formatted plaintext).

CONSTRAINTS
-----------
- Python 3.10+ only.
- Must use requests and beautifulsoup4 (bs4).
- Set a request timeout (default 5s) — never hang.
- Handle redirects gracefully (requests does this by default — be aware of it).
- NO use of the input built-in — all input via argparse.

OUTPUT CONTRACT (auto-grader depends on this)
---------------------------------------------
Print a summary containing at minimum:
    [HEADERS]
    Server: <value or "Not present">
    X-Powered-By: <value or "Not present">

    [COMMENTS]
    Found <n> HTML comment(s):
    1. <comment text>
    2. <comment text>

    [SENSITIVE PATHS]
    /robots.txt       → FOUND (200)
    /admin            → NOT FOUND (404)
    ...

EXAMPLE USAGE
-------------
    python web_enum.py http://192.168.56.101
    python web_enum.py http://192.168.56.101/dvwa --timeout 10

BUILD LOG
---------
Use docs/build.md to record what you find when running against Metasploitable.
HTML comments in particular — document what you find and what it implies.
This intelligence feeds directly into the Vulnerability Hunt diagnosis phase.
